Version: 1.0.0

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this project is to generate  of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.
